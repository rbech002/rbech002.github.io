        <p class="lead mb-4"> My name is Ricky Bechtel and I'm a Psychology student at University of California, Riverside. Psychology has interested me because I enjoy 
        analyzing both myself and other people, and learning more about how we function as human beings. Psychology is important, especially in times when we must 
        prioritize mental health. With my degree, I intend to move onto graduate school and earn my masters. With my masters, I intend to start the process
        of getting licensed to be a marriage family therapist. This license will allow me to see clients and talk with them one-on-one in therapy sessions. I intend to be 
        a therapist because I feel that people are the most interesting thing to learn about and to understand. 
        
        I do not have experience in the workforce just yet, but I have participated in extracurriculars in both high school and college. In high school, I participated in marching
        band for 4 years. This experience was full of hard work and dedication. We would attend rehearsal for 3 hours after school every other day, as well as attend 8 hour camps 
        on the weekends. For our second semester, we would also rehearse in the mornings before school for an hour every day. We would perform
        field shows at competitions and championships. Additionally, we would also perform in concerts at different high schools and be judged by
        a panel of band directors. Outside of highschool, I also participated in the San Bernardino County Honor Band and the Chaffey District Honor Band. I was also a section leader for the winds section during my senior year. I was in charge of making sure my group was there on time, teaching music to my section, teaching them how to march, and teaching them important visuals for our show. I also had to create assignments for them to practice, and make sure that they were performing as they were supposed to. I also was in charge of building bonds between the group, hosting events at my house or at the school where we would eat, talk, and hang out together to become stronger as a team. 
        
        Aside from band, I also participated in the National Honor Society. This club consisted of an application process where our GPA, grades,
        and extracurriculars would be considered. After being admitted, we participated in volunteer events such as creating cards for
        hospice patients, solving math problems for UNICEF Math, and answering vocabulary questions for donations at FreeRice. 

        At college, I participate in both the Starving Artists and Art Factory art clubs. These clubs meet every week or so and focus on building a community between the artists at UC Riverside. We support each other and focus on expressing our creative sides. I also participate in QTPOC, Queer Trans People of Color. At this club, we prioritize conversations about the intersections of queerness and race, and try to foster inclusivity within the LGBT community. 
        I've also become a CORE Volunteer member, a group of LGBT UCR students that work at paneling for LGBT seminars, table for fairs to promote queer events, and working at 
        queer events on campus.
